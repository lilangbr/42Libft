# Libft42

🔧 C, Makefile </br>
🌍 MacOs, Linux

The aim of this project is to code a C library regrouping usual functions that
we’ll be allowed to use in all us other projects at 42.

The most part is in C library (see man). 
Others are'nt in the C library but it will be so usefull further.

Rewriting the functions instead of using the ones that are already available in the system's libraries allows a better understanding of their functioning, the data structure, as well as the linux architecture.

## Use:

🚧 Build project functions:<br/>
```
42Libft $ make
```
🚧 🚧 Build bonus (project functions + bonus):<br/>
```
42Libft $ make bonus
```
🚿 Clean Obj files:<br/>
```
42Libft $ make clean
```
🚿 🚿 Clean All (obj files + binary):<br/>
