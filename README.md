# Libft42

The aim of this project is to code a C library regrouping usual functions that
weâ€™ll be allowed to use in all us other projects at 42.

The most part is in C library (see man). 
Others are'nt in the C library but it will be so usefull further. This functions are described in subject.

Bellow, some function's flowcharts  to understand how they are working. This was important when i thinked about their logic.
